# Cline's Rules

## General Principles
- **Memory Bank First:** Always read all Memory Bank files at the start of every task to ensure full context.
- **Iterative Development:** Break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Documentation Driven:** Maintain and update Memory Bank files as development progresses.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure all code, documentation, and communication are clear, concise, and precise.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in all developed solutions.

## File Management
- **Project Structure:** Organize new files within a dedicated project directory unless specified otherwise.
- **File Editing:** Prefer `replace_in_file` for targeted edits; use `write_to_file` for new files or complete overwrites.
- **Auto-formatting Awareness:** Always refer to the `final_file_content` after a `write_to_file` or `replace_in_file` operation, as auto-formatting may alter content.

## Tool Usage
- **One Tool at a Time:** Execute one tool per message and await user confirmation before proceeding.
- **Contextual Tool Selection:** Choose the most appropriate tool based on the current task and available information.
- **Command Execution:** Provide clear explanations for all `execute_command` calls. Tailor commands to the user's OS.
- **Browser Interaction:** Use `browser_action` for web-related tasks, following the launch-interact-close sequence.

## Communication
- **Direct and Technical:** Avoid conversational filler; be direct and technical in responses.
- **No Assumptions:** Do not assume tool success without explicit user confirmation.
- **Ask for Clarification:** Use `ask_followup_question` only when absolutely necessary to gather missing parameters.
- **Finality:** End `attempt_completion` results definitively, without questions or offers for further assistance.

## Project-Specific Rules (for current project)
- **macOS Focus:** All solutions must be compatible with macOS.
- **No External Python Dependencies:** Strictly adhere to using only Python's standard library.
- **`fio` Integration:** All disk benchmarking will rely on `fio`. Ensure `fio` is either present or instructions for its installation are provided.
- **QLab Relevance:** `fio` test parameters must be tuned to simulate QLab's 4K ProRes HQ video playback requirements.
